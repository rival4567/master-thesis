The real benefit of robots is taking over the three Ds, the dull, the dirty and dangerous jobs. \cite{jordan2016robots}

A prime example is the 7-axis cobot by Kassow Robots. This sophisticated robot is designed to mimic human movements, offering an extensive range of motion that allows it to handle intricate tasks, navigate tight spaces, and maintain consistent product quality in an industrial setting.
Whether it's assembling components, painting car parts, or welding, these robotic systems streamline operations by taking over repetitive, manual tasks that were traditionally carried out by humans.
These industrial robots not only increase efficiency and productivity but also promote safety.
They can operate in hazardous environments, reducing the risks associated with human intervention. 
Moreover, with the ability to work tirelessly around the clock, they ensure continuous production flows and uniform quality standards.

The robotic system consists of a manipulator from kassow robots with pneumatic grippers as the end-effector.
Pneumatic gripper is controlled by PLC. \hyperref[acro:VISOR]{VISOR\textsuperscript{\textregistered}} camera is also mounted on the tool-IO.
