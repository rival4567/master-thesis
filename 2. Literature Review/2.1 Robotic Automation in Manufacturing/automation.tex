\cite{kassowrobotsblog}Robotic automation has revolutionized the manufacturing industry by enhancing productivity, precision, and safety. Industrial robots are capable of performing a variety of tasks such as welding, assembly, material handling, and more recently, metal sheet bending. The Kassow robot, known for its high flexibility and precision, is an example of a modern industrial robot that can be effectively integrated into automated workcells.

Recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of robotic automation in reducing cycle times, minimizing errors, and improving product quality. For instance, Kang et al. (2017) showed how integrating robots into manufacturing lines can enhance efficiency and consistency. However, the successful implementation of robotic automation requires careful consideration of factors such as system design, control algorithms, and sensor integration.
