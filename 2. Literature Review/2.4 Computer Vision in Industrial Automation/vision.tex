Integrating robotics, computer vision, and a user-friendly interface into a cohesive system is critical for the successful automation of the bending process. This integration ensures that the robot can accurately detect and handle metal sheets, perform precise bending operations, and provide real-time feedback to the user.

Studies by Patel et al. (2017) and Garcia et al. (2021) have demonstrated the benefits of such integrated systems in various manufacturing applications. The integration process involves developing robust communication protocols, ensuring synchronization between components, and optimizing the system for real-time operation. The use of open-source platforms and modular design principles can facilitate this integration and enhance system flexibility.
