An effective user interface (UI) is crucial for monitoring and controlling robotic systems. The UI should provide real-time feedback, allow for easy control of the robot, and be accessible to users with varying levels of expertise. Web-based interfaces have gained popularity due to their accessibility and ease of deployment.

Research by Brown et al. (2019) and Nguyen et al. (2020) has emphasized the importance of intuitive UI design in enhancing user experience and system performance. Features such as real-time visualization of robotic motion, status indicators, and interactive controls are essential for effective UI. Developing a web interface for the robotic workcell can significantly enhance its usability and facilitate remote monitoring and control.
