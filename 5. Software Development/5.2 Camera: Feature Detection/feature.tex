Robotic camera is used for three operations. These include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Auto-calibration
    \item Find the pose of subsystems in the robotic workcell \textit{i.e.} Unloading station, drawers of shelf and the bending machine.
    \item 
\end{enumerate}



In teach pendant program tree, pose describes a frame transformation in 3D space \textit{i.e.} the three coordinates (x,y,z) and euler angles (R,P,Y) \textit{w.r.t.}
reference frame.
