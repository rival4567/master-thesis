This thesis presents the development of an advanced robotic workcell for automating the bending process of metal sheets using a Kassow robot, enhanced with two cameras for visual perception and quality control. The first camera, mounted on the robotic arm, detects metal sheets, while the second monitors the bending process and measures angles. A web interface provides real-time visualization of robotic motion and system status. The integration of hardware, development of control software, computer vision algorithms, and web interface ensures high efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility in the bending process. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in operational efficiency and product quality, highlighting the system's potential in industrial applications. Future work will focus on further optimizations and expanding functionalities to enhance adaptability. This research advances robotic automation in manufacturing, demonstrating the benefits of combining robotics, computer vision, and web technologies.
