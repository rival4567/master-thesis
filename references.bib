abstract = {The implementation of human-robot collaborative systems in industrial environments have widely extended during the last five years, from manufacturing applications reproduced in laboratory facilities or digital simulations to real automotive shop floors. Commonly, one way to guide their design has been through the adoption of international standards focused solely on the safe operation of collaborative robots. The main objective of this paper is the identification of basic components comprising human-robot collaborative systems design. This is supported by two steps, 1) Provide an extensive compendium of current applications and components within a varied set of manufacturing sectors and tasks. 2) Based on the latter, propose a selection of “structural components” for collaborative work. We conceptualized structural components as the organizational and technological alternatives necessary to fulfil the basic requirements and functionalities of human-robot collaborative systems. This document presents a systematic literature review that includes 50 exemplary case studies implemented in different manufacturing environments throughout the last five years praxis (2016–2020). Four structural components were identified in this paper: interaction levels, work roles, communication interfaces and safety control modes. Furthermore, it was found that physical contact-based collaboration for screwing assembly of small-sized parts and material handling of heavyweight objects are suitable applications for the automotive industry. Moreover, certified augmented and virtual reality devices were highlighted as convenient assistive technologies for safety and training manufacturing needs. The presented categorization will allow practitioners on selecting settings of compatible structural components that could respond better to trendy manufacturing requirements searching for highly personalized products.}

abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution, also labelled Industry 4.0, was beget with emergent and disruptive intelligence and information technologies. These new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. They also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Organizations need to consider Industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. Sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. In this study, we further examine Industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. We introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. We also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and VIKOR. This method can effectively evaluate Industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. We apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the World Economic Forum. The results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. Our recommendation is to take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. Investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing.}

The reconfigurable “plug-and-play” robot kinematic and dynamic modeling algorithms are developed. These algorithms are the basis for the control and simulation of reconfigurable robots. The concept of robot configuration optimization is introduced for the effective use of the rapidly reconfigurable robots. Control and communications of the workcell components are facilitated by a workcell-wide TCP/IP network and device-level CAN-bus networks. An object-oriented simulation and visualization software for the reconfigurable robot is developed based on Windows NT. Prototypes of the robot workcells configured to perform the light-machining task and the positioning task are constructed and demonstrated.}

abstract = {Digital twins offer great opportunities in various domains of the product engineering process. However, current approaches to the use of digital twins only focus on different separated disciplines. In contrast to that, it is expected that the holistic use of digital twin models in product development and production will dominate future product generations, because they allow to create high-performance products competitively. This paper explores important challenges and future potentials of digital twins and Industry 4.0 for the seamless integration of product specification and production. In this regard, approaches of linking digital twins to other domains open up new possibilities in tolerance allocation and production integration. Thereby, the most efficient product specifications in technical and economic terms are achieved for the manufacturer. In addition, the connectivity of Industry 4.0 broadens the scope and enables the evaluation of alternative approaches in production planning and control. Approaches at the organizational level, product functions with specifications beyond the technological limits and production control strategies (e.g. order dispatching) ensure high performance operations. Simulations with a digital production twin with integrated digital product twin allow early estimations even before the actual ramp-up of the product. The future challenge addressed in this paper is to define a consistent framework for the holistic use of digital twins in the entire product development process, which requires the integration of product designers and production planner concepts.}

The main goal of this paper is to create a fast emergency aid system for object detection in SME industrial premises. The basic assumption is that SMEs do not have any IT-trained personnel, and the solution has to be unsupervised edge computing. We use several off-the-shelf models of deep neural networks pre-trained for smart city applications, ready for online object recognition and edge computing. Our system works without any retraining, additional annotation, or human intervention. Specifically, we present heuristics for the automated creation of PGT (Pseudo-Ground Truth). Based on PGT, we can automatically decide which model is the best in the specific environment. We present an application of fully automated enhancing image capture camera outputs to smarter ones. We evaluate our system in a controlled experiment. Low-resolution cameras and large areas cause problems for our method. We present a proof-of-concept for improving our system even in these challenging situations. The benefit is a knowledge extraction in a simple and inexpensive way to expand the organizations’ databases with information from unstructured data from CCTV/IP cameras.}

After segmentation of the potato from the background, a pixel-wise classifier is trained to detect blemishes using features extracted from the image. A very large set of candidate features, based on statistical information relating to the colour and texture of the region surrounding a given pixel, is first extracted. Then an adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) is used to automatically select the best features for discriminating between blemishes and non-blemishes. With this approach, different features can be selected for different potato varieties, while also handling the natural variation in fresh produce due to different seasons, lighting conditions, etc. The results show that the method is able to build “minimalist” classifiers that optimise detection performance at low computational cost. In experiments, blemish detectors were trained for both white and red potato varieties, achieving 89.6% and 89.5% accuracy, respectively.}

The conveyor oriented apples so that the stem/calyx ends were not visible during image capture. Multi-spectral optics fabricated using a multi-vision linear filter mounted in front of the camera lens provided three different waveband (740, 950nm and visible) images of apples on a single camera array. Interference filters placed in the optical path provided the different wavebands. The diameter and height of each apple was measured to estimate the apple's volume. These dimensions and the position of the apple in the image allowed a portion of each image to be defined, the so-called region of interest (ROI). These sub-images made a composite image of the apple's surface.}

The visual detection of weed, crop and soil is an arduous task due to physical similarities between weeds and crop and to the natural and therefore complex environments (with non-controlled illumination) encountered. The image processing was divided in three different stages at which each different agricultural element is extracted: (1) segmentation of vegetation against non-vegetation (soil), (2) crop row elimination (crop) and (3) weed extraction (weed). For each stage, different and interchangeable methods are proposed, each one using a series of input parameters which value can be changed for further refining the processing. A genetic algorithm was then used to find the best value of parameters and method combination for different sets of images. The whole system was tested on several images from different years and fields, resulting in an average correlation coefficient with real data (bio-mass) of 84%, with up to 96% correlation using the best methods on winter cereal images and of up to 84% on maize images. Moreover, the method’s low computational complexity leads to the possibility, as future work, of adapting them to real-time processing.}

Existing commercial image processing systems work well in free-flowing traffic, but the systems have difficulties with congestion, shadows and lighting transitions. These problems stem from vehicles partially occluding one another and the fact that vehicles appear differently under various lighting conditions. We are developing a feature-based tracking system for detecting vehicles under these challenging conditions. Instead of tracking entire vehicles, vehicle features are tracked to make the system robust to partial occlusion. The system is fully functional under changing lighting conditions because the most salient features at the given moment are tracked. After the features exit the tracking region, they are grouped into discrete vehicles using a common motion constraint. The groups represent individual vehicle trajectories which can be used to measure traditional traffic parameters as well as new metrics suitable for improved automated surveillance. This paper describes the issues associated with feature based tracking, presents the real-time implementation of a prototype system, and the performance of the system on a large data set. ©}

abstract = {Industrial robots are used for various applications such as welding, handling, painting, inspection, and assembly in
automated production lines, especially in car manufacturing production. The typical operation of industrial robots is called
“teaching and playback”. In the teaching operation, an operator moves a robot to the series of points located on desired path
of the robot using a teach pendant and stores those positions. In the playback operation, the robot moves to the stored
positions sequentially and repeats the sequence. Because the robot follow the same path consist of the programed positions,
the target parts of the robot are required to be pre-oriented and aligned using part aligners or fixtures before the robot starts its
task.
Machine vision systems allow a robot to perform in more flexible manner. The vision systems are used for such
applications as detection of part orientation or position, part inspection and measurement. In the vision system, cameras
acquire object images, and the images are transferred to computers and analyzed using image processing software.
The result of the image processing is transferred to a robot controller and the position data of the robot is modified.
In this keynote speech, the roles of industrial robots and machine vision are presented.}

abstract={The propensity of manufacturers to produce goods at affordable cost, with more accuracy, and at a faster rate force them to search for novel solutions, such as deploying robots in place of people in a sector that can accommodate their needs. Welding is one of the most crucial processes in the automotive industry. This process is time-consuming, subject to error, and demands skilled professionals. The robotic application can improve this area of production and quality. Other industries, such as painting and material handling, can also profit from the use of robots. This work describes the fuzzy DC linear servo controller, which functions as a robotic arm actuator. Robots have been widely employed in most productive sectors in recent years, including assembly plates, welding, tasks at higher temperatures, etc. Controlling a robot accurately is a difficult undertaking as a robot is very nonlinear with many joints that are often organized and unstructured. To carry out the effective task, an effective PID control based on fuzzy logic has been employed together with the method of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach for the estimate of the parameter. This offline technique determines the lowest number of optimal robotic arm control parameters. To verify the controller design with computer simulation, a comparative assessment of controllers is given by means of a fuzzy surveillance controller with PSO which improves the parameter gain to provide a rapid climb, a smaller overflow, no steady condition error signal, and effective torque control of the robot arm.},
