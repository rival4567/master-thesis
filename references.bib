abstract = {The implementation of human-robot collaborative systems in industrial environments have widely extended during the last five years, from manufacturing applications reproduced in laboratory facilities or digital simulations to real automotive shop floors. Commonly, one way to guide their design has been through the adoption of international standards focused solely on the safe operation of collaborative robots. The main objective of this paper is the identification of basic components comprising human-robot collaborative systems design. This is supported by two steps, 1) Provide an extensive compendium of current applications and components within a varied set of manufacturing sectors and tasks. 2) Based on the latter, propose a selection of “structural components” for collaborative work. We conceptualized structural components as the organizational and technological alternatives necessary to fulfil the basic requirements and functionalities of human-robot collaborative systems. This document presents a systematic literature review that includes 50 exemplary case studies implemented in different manufacturing environments throughout the last five years praxis (2016–2020). Four structural components were identified in this paper: interaction levels, work roles, communication interfaces and safety control modes. Furthermore, it was found that physical contact-based collaboration for screwing assembly of small-sized parts and material handling of heavyweight objects are suitable applications for the automotive industry. Moreover, certified augmented and virtual reality devices were highlighted as convenient assistive technologies for safety and training manufacturing needs. The presented categorization will allow practitioners on selecting settings of compatible structural components that could respond better to trendy manufacturing requirements searching for highly personalized products.}

abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution, also labelled Industry 4.0, was beget with emergent and disruptive intelligence and information technologies. These new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. They also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Organizations need to consider Industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. Sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. In this study, we further examine Industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. We introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. We also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and VIKOR. This method can effectively evaluate Industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. We apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the World Economic Forum. The results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. Our recommendation is to take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. Investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing.}

abstract = {This article describes the development of a component-based technology robot workcell that can be rapidly configured to perform a specific manufacturing task. The workcell is conceived with standard and inter-operable components including actuator modules, rigid link connectors and tools that can be assembled into robots with arbitrary geometry and degrees of freedom. The reconfigurable “plug-and-play” robot kinematic and dynamic modeling algorithms are developed. These algorithms are the basis for the control and simulation of reconfigurable robots. The concept of robot configuration optimization is introduced for the effective use of the rapidly reconfigurable robots. Control and communications of the workcell components are facilitated by a workcell-wide TCP/IP network and device-level CAN-bus networks. An object-oriented simulation and visualization software for the reconfigurable robot is developed based on Windows NT. Prototypes of the robot workcells configured to perform the light-machining task and the positioning task are constructed and demonstrated.}

abstract = {Digital twins offer great opportunities in various domains of the product engineering process. However, current approaches to the use of digital twins only focus on different separated disciplines. In contrast to that, it is expected that the holistic use of digital twin models in product development and production will dominate future product generations, because they allow to create high-performance products competitively. This paper explores important challenges and future potentials of digital twins and Industry 4.0 for the seamless integration of product specification and production. In this regard, approaches of linking digital twins to other domains open up new possibilities in tolerance allocation and production integration. Thereby, the most efficient product specifications in technical and economic terms are achieved for the manufacturer. In addition, the connectivity of Industry 4.0 broadens the scope and enables the evaluation of alternative approaches in production planning and control. Approaches at the organizational level, product functions with specifications beyond the technological limits and production control strategies (e.g. order dispatching) ensure high performance operations. Simulations with a digital production twin with integrated digital product twin allow early estimations even before the actual ramp-up of the product. The future challenge addressed in this paper is to define a consistent framework for the holistic use of digital twins in the entire product development process, which requires the integration of product designers and production planner concepts.}

abstract = {Manufacturing enterprises are facing the need to align themselves to the new information technologies (IT) and respond to the new challenges of variable market demand. One of the key enablers of this IT revolution toward Smart Manufacturing is the digital twin (DT). It embeds a “virtual” image of the reality constantly synchronized with the real operating scenario to provide sound information (knowledge model) to reality interpretation model to draw sound decisions. The paper aims at providing an up-to date picture of the main DT components, their features and interaction problems. The paper aims at clearly tracing the ongoing research and technical challenges in conceiving and building DTs as well, according to different application domains and related technologies. To this purpose, the main questions answered here are: ‘What is a Digital Twin?’; ‘Where is appropriate to use a Digital Twin?’; ‘When has a Digital Twin to be developed?’; ‘Why should a Digital Twin be used?’; ‘How to design and implement a Digital Twin?’; ‘What are the main challenges of implementing a Digital Twin?’. This study tries to answer to the previous questions funding on a wide systematic literature review of scientific research, tools, and technicalities in different application domains.}

This interface can be used by users to control the motion of target robot, observe 3D model, and monitor the real-time value of the robot joints through PC or mobile device. The advantage of this system lies in its versatility and portability, allowing users to open the interface to control target robot in any place. This system mainly uses robot operating system (ROS), Html 5, C++, JavaScript and PHP technology. JavaScript library provided by ROS authority is used to build the front-end interface. PHP is used to create a user registration login system. Ros3djs is used to realize the establishment of dynamic model of robot simulation. The C++ library provided by ROS is used to synchronize the communication between the ROS node and the robot. Finally, the human-computer interaction system of the 16-DOF robotic hand is successfully implemented. According to the results, the system has good interactivity, versatility and portability.}
