abstract = {The implementation of human-robot collaborative systems in industrial environments have widely extended during the last five years, from manufacturing applications reproduced in laboratory facilities or digital simulations to real automotive shop floors. Commonly, one way to guide their design has been through the adoption of international standards focused solely on the safe operation of collaborative robots. The main objective of this paper is the identification of basic components comprising human-robot collaborative systems design. This is supported by two steps, 1) Provide an extensive compendium of current applications and components within a varied set of manufacturing sectors and tasks. 2) Based on the latter, propose a selection of “structural components” for collaborative work. We conceptualized structural components as the organizational and technological alternatives necessary to fulfil the basic requirements and functionalities of human-robot collaborative systems. This document presents a systematic literature review that includes 50 exemplary case studies implemented in different manufacturing environments throughout the last five years praxis (2016–2020). Four structural components were identified in this paper: interaction levels, work roles, communication interfaces and safety control modes. Furthermore, it was found that physical contact-based collaboration for screwing assembly of small-sized parts and material handling of heavyweight objects are suitable applications for the automotive industry. Moreover, certified augmented and virtual reality devices were highlighted as convenient assistive technologies for safety and training manufacturing needs. The presented categorization will allow practitioners on selecting settings of compatible structural components that could respond better to trendy manufacturing requirements searching for highly personalized products.}

abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution, also labelled Industry 4.0, was beget with emergent and disruptive intelligence and information technologies. These new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. They also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Organizations need to consider Industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. Sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. In this study, we further examine Industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. We introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. We also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and VIKOR. This method can effectively evaluate Industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. We apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the World Economic Forum. The results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. Our recommendation is to take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. Investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing.}
