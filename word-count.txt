                                       Abstract

    This thesis demonstrates the use of a robotic workcell for the automation of a bending
machine. The main objectives are to automate the bending process of a AMADA bending
machine and enhance accuracy of bent sheets. The robotic workcell consists of a 7-axis
collaborative robot, two VISOR® vision sensors, and a web-based UI. The robotic arm is
used for the automatic loading and unloading of metal sheets in the bending machine. To
achieve this, a VISOR® camera is mounted on the robot for sheet detection and robotic
perception. The second VISOR® is used for the angle measurement of bent part and
quality control. A web-based UI monitors the robot movement in the workcell which
acts as a digital twin. The benefits include reduction in manual labor and increased
throughput, with improved precision and efficiency. This work provides valuable insights
for the rapid development and deployment in the industry automation.

1.1     Background
The manufacturing sector is driven by the need of increased productivity. The need for
efficiency, precision, safety and cost reduction has led to significant push towards automa-
tion. The industrial growth is currently pushed by the Industrial 4.0: a fourth wave of
technological advancements that is connecting sensors, machines, and other IT systems.
These connected systems, also known as cyberphysical systems, may communicate with
one another via common Internet-based protocols and use data analysis to self-configure,
anticipate failure, and react to changes. Industry 4.0 is making it possible to have flexi-
bility in production by enabling faster and efficient processes. [8, 61]
    There are nine pillars of technological advancements, namely big data and analytics,
autonomous robots, simulation, horizontal and vertical system integration, the industrial
internet of things, cybersecurity, the cloud, additive manufacturing, augmented reality.
[61]
    Metal bending processes through an AMADA bending machine, used to rely heavily
upon the manual labor traditionally. Industry 4.0 is representing a transformation from
low skill manual labor to a sophisticated system that requires IT-related skills and innova-
tion abilities in the workforce. Robotic Automation would have less variability in product
quality and will not expose operators to physical strain and repetitive motion injuries.
Collaborative robots with vision sensors [93] allows to have flexibility in manufacturing of
metal sheets. It means robot can be programmed to perform bending of different metal
sheets when required. [76]


1.2     Problem Statement
Manual bending of metal sheets is labor-intensive and can lead to human errors, resulting
in inconsistent quality and inefficiency. The automation of this process with a collabora-
tive robot poses several challenges, which includes the precise detection and processing of
sheet metal parts, the accurate execution of the bend operation and the coordination of
the robotic system with other systems in the workcell.
    This robotic workcell will have automatic loading and unloading of metal sheets in
the AMADA bending machine and will use computer vision to detect and measure the
bend angle of metal sheets. In addition, a user-friendly interface will be developed for
monitoring the robotic workcell.

1.3      Objectives
The objectives of this research are as follows:

  1. Designing and developing a robotic workcell capable of bending metal sheets au-
     tonomously. The workcell includes AMADA HFP80-25 NT as the bending machine
     to be automated, KR1410 as the robot, SensoPart vision sensors as cameras, an
     unloading station to get sheets from the operator and a shelf for placing the sheets.

  2. Integration of computer vision technology to detect metal sheets accurately for pick-
     up and measure bending angle. One VISOR® vision sensor mounted on the KR1410
     will be used for sheet detection and second VISOR® placed in robot workspace for
     measuring bending angle. Communication between the vision sensor and KR needs
     to be setup using Telegram.

  3. Building a web interface for the visualization and monitoring of robotic workcell in
     real-time. The web application interfaces with the KR through ROS Bridge library.
     The interface uses web development technologies like ReactJS, NodeJS, Javascript,
     HTML and CSS.

  4. Evaluating the efficiency and accuracy of the robotic workcell in industrial environ-
     ments and compare it with already existing solution.


1.4      Scope
The development of robotic workcell that can be rapidly configured has a major influence
on the manufacturing industry. It allows for more flexibilty and mass customization in
production of parts. [15] Automating the bending process allows manufacturers to increase
productivity, safety, flexibility, and overall process efficiency while having the option for
customization. [61, page 9]
   This thesis contributes to the broadest field of industrial automation and robotics and
shows how Industry 4.0 can transform traditional manufacturing processes. The scope
consists of:

   • Programming control software for the robotic system.

   • Integration of computer vision systems for the detection and inspection of metal
     sheets.

   • Building a web interface for monitoring and visualization.

   • Experimental evaluation of system performance in the industrial environment.

   The thesis does not discuss other aspects of metal manufacturing or the integration of
other manufacturing processes. The programming of the second robot i.e. Franka Emika
panda robot and PLC in the robotic workcell is out of scope of this thesis.

ing both hardware and software components. Chapter 5 discusses the programming of
the control software and web interface. Chapter 6 presents the calibration process and
evaluation of the entire robotic workcell using a specimen sheet metal part. Chapter 7

2       Literature Review
2.1     Robotic Automation in Manufacturing
Industrial robots were first used for repetitive tasks and material handling. The first
industrial robot, Unimate was deployed by General Motors in 1961. It weighed two
tons and worked on assembly lines, autonomously lifting heaving objects and welding
car parts. Since then robots have evolved to become versatile device that can perform
complex tasks, learn from experience, communicate through devices, and collaborate with
human workers. [11]
    Industrial robots are the right solution for high-volume production process for their
efficiency, uptime and quality. [18] As the manufacturing industry moves smaller batch
production, cobots would be much more useful and flexible in a smart workcell. Cobots
are vastly more advanced and affordable than industrial robots. [19] Common use cases
of robotic automation in manufacturing include material handling [22, 75], welding [78],
assembly [29], pick-and-place [72], palletizing [35], and even metal sheet bending [84].
    Automation is particularly useful in industrial where there is a risk for human opera-
tors. In [25], robotic automation has been implemented for the manufacturing of footwears
which is a hazardous environment for human workers. In it a robotic workcell consisting
of three robots is controlled and coordinated through ROS.
    With the CPS, the machines in the robotic workcell communicate and share data with
each other with which production process is improved. Also, whole production process
can be monitored remotely.[36, page 105] With the AM technologies, design to production
time is vastly decreased. [36, page 116]. The benefits of automation can often outweigh
the initial costs. This way Industry 4.0 is transforming manufacturing sector.


2.2     Automated Bending Processes
Sheet metal bending is a process in which bends are formed using a combination of a
punch and a die. This process is used to create large number of mechanical products
such as furniture panels, shelves, cabinets, housing for electro-mechanical devices etc. [3]
The project partner for this thesis i.e. mech-tron GmbH & Co. KG excels in the
manufacturing of housing systems for electronic and embedded equipment. In this thesis,
manufacturing of one of these sheet metal housing systems will be automated by means
of robotic workcell.
    There are various companies in the market which offers automated bending cells.
They use industrial robot to feed and bend the parts in the bending machine. [38, 73,

                                                                                     Page 4

79] or systems to assist the bending which are called bending followers and sheet-feeder.
[24] However, using a collaborative robot to perform bending tasks is challenging. A
collaborative robot generally has low payload capacity and requires better robot motion
planning during bending to avoid exceeding joint torques. In [37], a cobot is used to
collaborate with a bending machine to perform 3D curving of metal wire and discusses
the difficulties in holding the part in low payload robot gripper during bending and defines
the generation of optimum robot motion considering the combined task and motion level
constraints.
    In the article [20], two cobots from UR are used for automated bending. The cobot
can perform challenging bend sequences with the help of a regrip station. In similar way,
unloading station is used for regrasping purposes to change the way the cobot presents
the part to the bending machine.


2.2.1     ASTRO bending cell
AMADA already offers an automated solution for the bending process in means of a
system called ASTRO bending cell. This system consists of a handling robot which can
perform production of smaller, complex workpieces and have uniformity in production.
However, press brake and the know-how of handling robot come from AMADA. The
project partner has one of these systems i.e. ASTRO-100 II NT HDS 1030 in their
production floor.
    The ASTRO-100 II NT cell is an “island solution” that is only available in the HDS-
1030 press configuration, ASTRO HP-20 loading and unloading robot, ASTRO-100 II NT
bending robot and the external software ASTRO CAM. The ASTRO-100 II NT cell. [6]
The production using these system is continous and very fast.
    The main drawback of this system is the software ASTRO-CAM, which is owned by
AMADA, and offers less flexibility and requires support from AMADA for programming.
Without any vision sensors, the system is not smart. It can perform repetitive tasks
very fast and with very little interference from operator but without any decision making.
Also, the ASTRO robot is non-collaborative and humans cannot work alongside it. It
requires a large area on the production floor which incurs more cost.
    In this thesis, this system will be compared to our robotic workcell solution which has
collaborative robot and is more cost-effective.


2.3     Robotic System
The real benefit of robots is taking over the three Ds, the dull, the dirty and dangerous
jobs. [30] The functionality of a robotic system during any step of control should include
three principal performance features in the cognitive process: perception, recognition and


                                                                                     Page 5
                                                 CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW


decision making. It is obvious that the autonomy of the whole robotic system directly cor-
responds to sensory equipment, processing sensory information and decision algorithms.
[26]
    Robots systems are used in industrial environments for assembling parts, painting cars
or welding operations. [63, 86]. Robots could be arranged in assembly lines to carry out
a particular repetitive task. With the development in robotic perception and algorithms,
robotic systems could be placed in a workcell to perform multiple tasks sequentially.
Sensory systems plays an important role to develop intelligent robotic systems. [86]. Using
smart sensors, a single robotic arm could perform various tasks by making decisions.
    There are various kind of robotic arms available in the market. These include industrial
robots as well as cobots. Cobots are generally more sensitive and easier to program. They
are also more safe to work with humans as compared to industrial robots. Industrial
robots require an enclosed space for safety reasons. However, they are more durable and
the speed is high. [62] Robotic arm also comes in different number of DOF. 6-axis robotic
arms are mostly common, but an additional axis from a 7-axis cobot is advantageous in
our case for collision free trajectory planning in a large workspace.
    A good example of cobot is the 7-axis cobot by Kassow Robots. This sophisticated
robot can mimic human movements and offers an extensive range of motion that allows it
to handle intricate tasks, navigate tight spaces, and maintain consistent product quality
in an industrial setting. These cobots not only increase efficiency and productivity but
also promote safety. They can operate in industrial environments and reduces the risks
associated with humans as they are collaborative. With the ability to work tirelessly
nonstop, theese cobots ensure continuous production and uniform quality standards. [76]


2.3.1     Robot Operating System
The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools which help to
build robot applications. Because it is open-source, there is flexibility where and how to
use ROS, as well as the freedom to customize if it requires. [17] ROS is utilized to build,
control or simulate various kind of robots, from mobile robots to robotic arms. [33] It
could also be used in partnership with a simulation environment like Gazebo. This will
fasten the development process and also make decisions before actually buying a robot.
    In [77], a simulation environment is created for mobile robots using ROS and gazebo
and later tested with the real robot, showcasing the usability of the ROS for the devel-
opment process. In [45], a manipulator is simulated for the pick and place operation.
There are numerous robots build using ROS and is used extensively by both hobbyists
and robotic developers and is a powerful tool.

2.4     Computer Vision in Industrial Automation
Computer vision (CV) techniques have played an important role in promoting the informa-
tion, digitization, and intelligence of industrial manufacturing systems. In manufacturing
industry, CV applications include inspection and quality control, object detection and
process control. In recent years, advancements in camera technology, image processing
algorithms, and CV techniques have significantly increased the capabilities of vision sys-
tems in manufacturing systems. The most common methods of CV are features detection,
recognition, segmentation, and three-dimensional (3D) modeling. [94]
     CV technologies are required for the successful automation of the bending process.
KR1410 robotic arm should be able to correctly detect and pick metal sheets and then
perform precise bending operations. With CV, images can be analyzed in real-time, al-
lowing for feedback and adjustment for the automated bending process. This capability is
necessary to maintain a high production rate while maintaining good precision. There are
many examples of CV being used in industrial environments, like in the sorting and clas-
sification of food products [9, 81, 14], monitoring and safety management of construction
projects [43] or the automated traffic monitoring system. [34, 16]
     The smart extensions of CV are added to the regular cameras in the industrial environ-
ments, which improves the performance of manufacturing or other automation processes.
[12] However, it requires image processing algorithms to run on separate hardware. The
VISOR® vision sensor has a processor in its housing and does not require a PC or PLC
to run. A PC or laptop is required only in order to configure the VISOR® vision sensor.
[68, page 23]


2.5     User Interfaces for Industrial Systems
Product development process can greatly benefit from the integration of the digital twin
models. According to [65], digital twin (DT) embeds a ”virtual” image of the reality
constantly synchronized with the real operating scenario to provide sound information
(knowledge model) to reality interpretation model to draw sound decisions.
    In manufacturing industry, a digital twin can replicate an individual machine, a cell,
a complete line. Digital twin and virtual commissioning are two terms that often come
when talking about Industry 4.0. Both use virtual representations of physical systems to
save time, enable better training, and identify improvement opportunities, among other
benefits. However, the digital twin requires a physical equivalent with IoT technology
for data transfer. Virtual commissioning requires simulation of all the signals with their
timings and sensors and actuator responses. It can exist without a physical system. [27]
    Digital twin enables the creation of high-performance products and optimize produc-
tion systems by allowing early estimations and later re-configurations. The connectivity

                                                                                    Page 7
                                                  CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW


of Industry 4.0 technologies is highlighted as a key strategy for achieving the most efficient
product specifications in technical and economic terms for the manufacturer. Simulations
with a digital production twin open up new possibilities in production integration. [85]
    In this thesis, virtual commissioning is first accomplished in order to speed up the
development process. The next step is to get the data from the real robotic system and
use it to test and verify the virtual model. This will be the digital twin model which will
help in:

  1. Identify collision points in the real world and use it to plan trajectory.

  2. Monitor and optimize the loading and unloading process.

  3. Offer testing opportunities for a new product model.

    A functional UI is required for monitoring and controlling robotic systems. When
envisioning the design principles for UIs, the UI should be understandable, reliable and
accessible. [91] The UI should be designed for an untrained user, offer feedback, have
robust error handling in case of system failure, and usable for users with varying levels
of experience. Web-based interfaces have gained popularity due to their accessibility and
ease of deployment. Versatile and accessible UI could be created using web technologies
and ROS for robot control. In the paper [92], a web-based interface is created that utilizes
ROS alongside HTML5, JS and C++, allows for remote control, real-time monitoring,
and 3D visualization of robots. It uses Ros3Djs library to simulate the motion of the robot
on web interface. ROS-based dashboard is also developed for an autonomous wheelchair
using Rosbridge in [28], highlighting the potential of open source technologies to build a
DT.

3       System Design
3.1     Overview of the Robotic Workcell
Robotic workcell has to be designed keeping in mind the workspace of handling robot.
Handling robot has to able to reach every station in the workspace without any collision.
The workcell is first developed in simulation with the use of ROS and gazebo software.
This reduced the development time as it allowed for quick changes to the workcell.
    The preliminary designs for the robotic workcell were elaborated in the form of CAD
models and successively converted into final CAD designs. These CAD models were later
converted to suitable file format like .stl and .dae for the simulation software ROS. These
meshes are then utilized to build up the whole workcell in ROS and gazebo. Robot is
defined in URDF file format that includes the physical description of the robot. [90]
This simulated environment in gazebo is used to update and fix the final layout of the
robotic workcell. Trajectories are planned to various subsystems in workcell using ROS
to determine to final position of robot in workcell. Figure ?? shows the final layout of
the workcell in gazebo software. It consists of various subsystems which include bending
machine, storage station, unloading station, handling robot, bending machine terminal
operating robot and safety fence.
    The subsystems are described in more detail in the following subsections.
    Sheets are loaded by workcell operator in the unloading station. Sheet metal parts are
picked up by the handling robot and taken to bending machine to perform bending. After
all the bending operations are complete, sheet metal parts are stored in storage station.
The relation between each subsystem and the flow of energy, data, and material is shown
in Figure ??.


3.1.1    Bending machine
Bending machine as a unit comes with a terminal and a foot pedal. Terminal is used to
operate the bending machine for starting, stopping and configuring the bending machine
and also loading the bending program. Foot pedal comes with two pedals, one for closing
the bending machine and other for opening of the bending machine. Opening and closing
of bending machine is controlled by a foot pedal for the manual bending operations.
    To automated the bending machine, PLC is used to send signals to foot pedal which
in turn, controls the opening and closing of bending machine.
    An inspection camera is also added to measure the bending angle after each bending
operation. This inspection camera is operated by the PLC and the bending angles are


                                                                                    Page 9
                                                        CHAPTER 3: SYSTEM DESIGN


saved in .csv file format and displayed on a HMI.


3.1.2     Storage station
The storage station is a shelf with 10 drawers. The drawers of the shelf can be automat-
ically opened and closed by the handling robot. It is a mechanical system which is used
to store final bended sheet metal parts.
    When the storage station is full, human operators are to replace a filled shelf with a
new empty shelf with a forklift. Thus, this is the only station which is not fixed in the
robotic workcell. The robotic camera mounted on the handling robot needs to determine
the correct position of the storage station after each restart.


3.1.3     Unloading station
The task of the removal station is to take a single sheet metal part from a stack of
raw sheets and make it available to the robot unit. This is a mechatronic system with
several different components, which all have to function individually, but also together in
combination. The mechatronic system is controlled by the PLC.
   This unloading station is on top of a cabinet which houses the PLC and controller of
the handling robot.


3.1.4     Handling robot
Handling robot is the primary robot which handles the sheet metal parts to different
subsystems i.e. unloading station, bending machine and storage station. It coordinates
with the PLC to make decisions during the execution of the program. Reachability is very
important in this case, as it should be able to handle sheet metal parts in any orientation.
A two finger gripper is used for grasping the sheet metal parts.
    To get accuracy with the bending process, detection of features on the sheet metal
parts is required. A robotic camera is mounted of the robot for this purpose. In this way,
handling robot can be trained to operate with different variants of sheet metal parts.
    ROS simulations of the handling robot is done to determine the performance of robot
in the workcell. The drawers of storage system is especially close to the production floor
and the robot requires some space to move around without getting stuck. Reachability is
tested with the simulation of trajectories before the final integration of the real robot in
the workcell.


3.1.5     Bending machine terminal operating robot
Together with the company VisCheck GmbH, an operating unit is developed for en-
tering parameters on the operating terminal and reading relevant values on the operating

                                                                                   Page 10
                                                         CHAPTER 3: SYSTEM DESIGN


terminal of the bending machine. The unit consists of a franka emika robot, a camera for
reading terminal values and a computer for controlling the robot. A touch screen pointer
is attached to the gripper of the robot for operating the touch screen of terminal.
    As it is programmed by another company, it is not simulated in the software and not
coordinated for any trajectory planning. Sufficient floor space is left near the terminal of
bending machine in the robotic workcell for the installation of this robot. The trajectories
of handling robot are not planned anywhere near this robot. To setup this, safety zone is
created during the programming of the handling robot.


3.1.6     Safety fence
Safety fence marks the boundary of the robotic workcell. Even though the robot final-
ized is a collaborative robot, bending machine poses a safety concern as it is operated
automatically by the PLC. The sheet metal parts are sharp around the corners and when
handled by the robot is deemed as not safe.
    Two doors are installed for an entry in the robotic workcell. One is close to the storage
system and is used to move shelf in-and-out of the workcell by a forklift. The doors are
installed with a safety mechanism by which if the door is open, the whole robot unit and
bending machine cannot operate. This safety mechanism is again controlled by the PLC.
Safety fence is only installed at the end of the project by the company. A simulation of
the fence with ROS and gazebo is not necessary in this case and is not included as assets
in gazebo.


3.2      Requirements for the overall system
  1. A key requirement for the mobile robot unit is to be able to cope with the limited
     space available in the project partner’s production hall. Specifically, this means that
     only an area of approximately 2m × 4.5m is available in front of the sheet metal
     bending machine.

  2. Another point is the operating time of the overall system. The unit should be able
     to autonomously manage a day shift of eight hours and a night shift of six hours
     without any major personnel intervention.

  3. Robot should also be able to handle various sheet metal part variants, i.e. different
     component sizes and geometries. In addition to the flexible handling of different
     sheet metal parts, the focus is also on the simple integration of new variants into the
     existing system. Some of the sheet metal parts in production are of small size. These
     sheets will have little gripping surface after few bendings. Special considerations
     needs to be given to the gripper design so that robot can handle sheet metal parts


                                                                                    Page 11
                                                       CHAPTER 3: SYSTEM DESIGN


      of small and medium sizes. (from 60mm × 110mm to upto 115mm × 220mm) The
      sheets should not move in the gripper during the movement of the robotic arm.

  4. The mobile robot unit is to be used as a supplement to manual production. It is
     therefore necessary that it can be set up and dismantled quickly and easily in front
     of the bending machine.

  5. The hand-eye calibration using a vision sensor could degrade over time due to envi-
     ronmental factors such as temperature changes or vibrations. [7] This will decrease
     the accuracy of robot TCP in positioning and grasping leading to incorrect bending.
     The robot should be able to automatically recalibrate without any long delays when
     there is a request by the operator.

  6. The angle measurement on the bent sheet should be carried out using a camera
     system after each bending process. Based on the measured angle, bending machine
     should be re-adjusted for the next iteration. The necessary values should also be
     entered at the operator terminal by the terminal operating robot. In addition,
     a continuous real-time status query of the bending machine is required via the
     operating terminal. For the implementation of this subtask, the company is working
     with VisCheck GmbH, which specializes in reading screens using a camera and

3.3     Hardware Selection

3.3.1    AMADA bending machine
A bending machine that is manufactured in 2005 and no longer in production is chosen
for this project. The bending machine from AMADA is a manual hydraulic press brake
that is operated by foot pedal. It does not comes with a system that allows for automated
bending process. Table 3.1 shows the technical specifications of the bending machine.
    The AMADA bending machine allows for programming the 5-axis backgauge in the
bending machine. It means for a specific bending operation, the tool and die the 5-axis
backgauge moves in position accordingly and holds the sheet metal part in place. It is also
possible to change bending operation by selecting the bending operation number from the
terminal. This is done by the controller i.e. AMNC of the press brake.
    It is also possible to quickly change a tool in the bending machine. It has a punch
holder system which allows quick and secure tool changes. The hydraulic system provides
the force needed for the bending operations. The hydraulic system does not have any load
upto a set point below which it start bending. This allows for an extremely fast approach
and return speeds. [5]

    The bending machine has a laser monitoring device as shown in ?? This device from
Fiessler GmbH come pre-installed with the bending machine and is a press brake safety
measure. It stops the closing of bending machine if a finger or something else is detected
inside the bending machine.


3.3.2    Kassow Robots: KR1410
KR1410 is a 7-axis collaborative robotic arm from Kassow Robots. It has a reachability
of 1400 mm which fits satisfactory in the workcell. A seventh axis is particulary useful as
it allows more freedom during trajectory planning especially in close spaces. Five out of
seven joints could do two full rotations.
    The robotic arm comes with a robot controller and a teach pendant as shown in Figure
?? A robot controller is the main controlling unit for each KR manipulator. Teach Pendant
is used for programming the manipulator and also provides UI and safety controls. The
robot can be operated manually and automatically. It is automated, programmable and
capable of moving in up to seven axes. The robot is typically used for welding, painting,
assembly, pick and place, packaging and labelling. These are all carried out while ensuring
high endurance, speed, and precision. [49, page 23]
    Kassow Robots can be integrated with other devices via Profinet. Each robot that
is equipped with optional Profinet HW interface can act as a Profinet IO-Device. This

means that such robot can be monitored and controlled by any Profinet IO-Controller (for
example PLC). [44] KR1410 could be also interfaced with ROS. KR provides packages to
install through which KR messages communication is set up to a PC. These messages are
used to get the current joint configuration of the robot and simulate it in ROS or web UI.
[51]
    KR also provides developmental environment to add new robotic peripherals, like
grippers or sensors. This development environment is CBun, which allows writing KR
software in C++ for a specific peripheral. It is used in order to setup communication
between VISOR camera functions and the robot. [48]


3.3.3    Camera System: VISOR® Vision Sensor
According to VISOR® [68, page 22] user manual, the VISOR® vision sensor is an optical
sensor and is used for the non-contact acquisition or identification of objects. The vision
sensor features a number of different evaluation methods (detectors), like contour, pattern
matching, Target Mark 3D, BLOB and others. The VISOR® vision sensor is a cost-
effective alternative to conventional image processing systems as discussed in section 2.4
The processing is done inside the camera housing only. It is a combination of sophisticated

    VISOR® vision sensor is a suitable choice for the identification and classification of
metal sheets for the automated bending process. These sensors enable precise detection
and processing of features on sheet metal parts, which leads to the efficiency and accuracy
of automated bending process. The camera can be connected to a PLC or PC through
ethernet or profinet. The VISOR software is installed on the PC and then the camera
can be configured and jobs can be added.[69]. A total of 255 jobs with 255 detectors each
can be configured on the camera.
    Two camera are selected from SENSOPART. One for the robot which is used to detect
the sheet metal parts and the target mark; and the other for inspection jobs.

1.   Robotic Camera

This camera is a VISOR® Robotic V20 vision sensor with 1440×1080 resolution, wide lens
and a red LED light. [71] A hand-eye calibration is required in order to transform camera
poses to robot frame. This camera does not use internal illumination to detect objects as
the working distance is 300.0 mm which is large enough for internal illumination to full
brighten the sheet metal part. A tailored interface is developed for KR teach pendant for
this camera to make it communicate with the robot using CBuns.

                                                                                  Page 15
                                                       CHAPTER 3: SYSTEM DESIGN


2.   Inspection Camera

The inspection camera is a VISOR® V20 Object vision sensor with 1440×1080 resolution
and red LED light. [70] This camera gets the bending angle of the bent sheet metal part.
The robot brings the bent sheet metal parts to the inspection camera. It uses internal
illumination of red light to measure the angle as working distance is only around 100
mm.


3.3.4    PLC
PLC A programmable logic controller (PLC) is a special form of microprocessor-based con-
troller that uses programmable memory to store instructions and to implement functions
such as logic, sequencing, timing, counting, and arithmetic in order to control machines
and processes. [10, page 5] It is an industrial computer that has been ruggedized and
adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as system monitoring, motor
control, workcells, or any activity that requires high reliablity, ease of programming, and
process fault diagnosis. [2]
    PLC from the manufacturer Siemens are called SIMATIC Controller. [74] A SIMATIC
HMI is also added to the top of front panel of the unloading station to provide revelant
information to the operator as shown in figure ?? PLC is used to manage everything in
robotic workcell, from giving instructions to the KR to controlling the bending machine
and unloading station.


3.3.5    Gripper
The gripper is selected according to payload, gripping force and opening width. The
opening width is the dominant selection criterion here, as the gripper must be able to
grip both the thin sheets with thicknesses of around 1 to 3 mm and the handle on the
drawers with a width of 15 mm. An electric gripper was considered, as the power supply
could have been provided via the cable already integrated in the robot. Due to the higher
costs, the double height and the weight, a pneumatic gripper was chosen.
    A universal schunk gripper PGN-plus-P 80-1 is chosen which is a 2-finger parallel
pneumatic gripper with permanent lubrication, high gripping force, and high maximum
moments due to the use of a multi-tooth guidance. [64] It is also possible to know if the
gripper is open or closed because of a sensor inside the housing of gripper. This value of
sensor is sent to the PLC to detect if the gripper is closed.

1.   Robotic Gripper

The robotic gripper is mounted on the KR1410. This gripper is used for grasping the
sheet metal parts, perfrom bending operation and opening or closing the drawers of shelf.

2.   Unloading Station Gripper

The pneumatic parallel gripper is mounted on the pneumatic swivel unit which can turn
180°. This allows the transfer the sheet metal part from unloading station to the robotic
gripper.


3.4     Software Architecture
To find out the software version and development environent used in the development of
the workcell, check the appendix ??.


3.4.1    Simulation Software
Before building the robotic workcell in the real world, the kassow robot is simulated in
the ROS and gazebo software environment.

1.   ROS

For more information on ROS, see section 2.3.1. A URDF model of the KR1410 with
gripper attached is created complete with all positions of links, joints, sensors, models
etc. This URDF description of robot is then ready to be tested in the workcell. Few
open-source additional packages were also used for building this simulation. For example,
for attaching an object to the finger joint which simulates a grasping action in gazebo
simulator. [13]
    The robotic motion of unloading station gripper and the manipulation of KR1410
using the robotic gripper is simulated using ROS. (See Figure ??)


                                                                                 Page 17
                                                         CHAPTER 3: SYSTEM DESIGN


    Many custom ROS packages [54] are created to simulate the workcell. A single ROS
launch [56] file is launched to run every node [58], service [57] and parameter [55] or action
servers [60] Figure ?? visualizes the computation graph of the simulation. It shows the
currently active ROS nodes [58] and topics [59] in the simulation of robotic workcell.

2.   Gazebo Simulator

Gazebo is a 3D dynamic simulator with the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate
populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. While similar to
game engines, Gazebo offers physics simulation at a much higher degree of fidelity, a suite
of sensors, and interfaces for both users and programs. [23]
    A model of the entire workcell is created for the gazebo simulator. The assets are
converted from CAD designs to .dae and .stl file format using blender software. These
meshes are then included in the SDF model object. The workcell is then ready to be
simulated in the gazebo simulator.

3.   RViz

RViz is short for ROS Visualization. It is a 3D visualization software tool for robots,
sensors, and algorithms. It allows seeing the robot’s perception of its world (real or
simulated). The purpose of RViz is to visualize the state of a robot. It uses sensor data
to try to create an accurate depiction of what is going on in the robot’s environment. [40]

4.   MoveIt

MoveIt is a software for ROS used for manipulation, motion planning, 3D perception,
kinematics, control and navigation. [39] MoveIt is used to get the solve the kinematics of
the 7-axis kassow robot and do robotic manipulation and perception. A collision mesh of
the workcell is published in the planning scene as can be seen in RViz in Figure ??. This
makes the KR1410 to plan trajectories without any collision in the workcell. The robotic
gripper is also controlled using MoveIt package.


3.4.2     VISOR Communication Setup
VISOR software is not officially supported by the KR1410 and there is no direct integra-
tion of the VISOR camera available. However, Kassow robots provides support to build
own software through CBun development. The CBun (Capability Bundle) represents a
modular framework within the KR software system, which encapsulates functionalities
and provides the access to its predefined API.
    The CBun SDK is the Software Development Kit that provides all essential tools
for CBun development. The project setup is created in a Visual Studio Code container


                                                                                     Page 18
                                                       CHAPTER 3: SYSTEM DESIGN


running on Ubuntu 18.04 with a special set of software packages. [48] The header files are
located in include directory and C++ source file i.e. VISOR Communication.cpp are
placed in src directory. Upon building the project, a SENSOPART.cbun file is generated
as shown in ?? It is then installed in the teach pendant using a USB. Figure ?? shows
the information of VISOR variables getting through the VISOR to KR1410.
    CBun device is one of the CBun elements. CBun Device concept allows to wrap
handling code of physical device like VISOR vision sensor into the CBun and hide it from
the end user. This allows the user to simply control and monitor devices without the need
to implement the communication and logic. [47]
    VISOR camera is powered from the TPSU02 on the KR1410 tool-IO. A CBun device
named VISOR from CBun developement is created which has methods for controlling
the functionalities of camera like changing job, getting object pose by triggering camera
and performing calibration. Through this device, the KR communicates with the VISOR
over telegram.


3.4.3    Program Tree
Kassow Robots teach pendant is a graphical user interface which allows users to control
robot arm and HW equipment, build and run programs and configure robot installation
setup. It is intended to be intuitive as it comes with familiar design of a tablet. The
main screen interface is based on a double pane layout between which there is a command
box. The command box provides access to basic building blocks, loaded CBun devices,
and subroutines defined by the operator. These commands can be dragged and dropped
into the program tree. [52, page 15] There is a control mode in the bottom which can
set the master speed or launch the program and control the execution process. (pause,
continue, terminate). The program tree view is where the robot program is built in
an intuitive graphical way. A program tree contains atleast one sequence. A sequence
contains a number of commands that are executed sequentially. For separate sequences,
the commands are executed simulataneously and asynchronously. [52, page 20]
    The programming of KR1410 is done in the program tree for one sheet metal part
variant. It is done so as to test the bending process using the KR1410. The program
tree of the workcell consists of four sequences which runs in parallel. Sequence 1 is the
main program which runs all the pick-place and bending operations. Sequence 2 and 3
looks for a signal from PLC for pausing and terminating the current program respectively.
Sequence 4 controls the robotic and unloading station grippers using a push button for
manual operation of the gripper in case of emergency.
    The robot is programmed using a number of subprograms such that a subprogram can
be quickly imported in the sequence and is intuitive to understand as shown in figure ??
Besides normal RCommands like IF, LOOP, FOR, MOVE, WAIT and so on, there are a


                                                                                  Page 19

number of CBun devices from Kassow Robots imported like the IK, FK and WATCHER
devices. IK is used to get the inverse kinematics from a pose and FK is used to get the
forward kinematics from a joint configuration. Custom made Cbuns modules for VISOR
are also used for auto-calibration and for getting the pose in the robot frame of a detected
object in the workspace using the VISOR vision sensor.


3.4.4     Web UI
1.   Front-end technologies

Front-end development is the development of visual and interactive elements of a website
that users interact with directly. It’s a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where
HTML provides the structure, CSS the styling and layout, and JavaScript the dynamic
behaviour and interactivity. [32]

Reactjs is the most popular front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
It user interfaces out of individual pieces called components written in JavaScript. [46]

2.   Backend technologies

Backend development refers to the server-side aspect of web development, focusing on
creating and managing the server logic, databases, and APIs. It involves handling user
authentication, authorization, and processing user requests, typically using backend de-
velopment languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript (Node.js), and .NET. [31]

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets
developers create servers, web application etc. The web application for robotic workcell
is built and hosted on a Node.js server. [41]

npm is a package manager for Node.js. It stands for Node Package Manager. Through
this, ROS web tools for server-side runtime are installed like roslib, ros3djs. [42]

3.   ROS Web Tools

Robot Web Tools are open-source libraries and tools for building web-based robot apps
with ROS. Rosbridge, roslibjs, ros3Djs, and visualization-rwt packages are used for build-
ing the web application which are part of ROS Web Tools. [82] Rosbridge and visualization-
rwt are installed on the ROS workspace for robotic workcell. Roslibjs and ros3Djs are
libraries for building the web application and are installed on the server built on Node.js.

Rosbridge The WebSocket makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communi-
cation session between the user’s browser and a server. With this API, messages can be
sent to a server and received through event-driven responses without having to poll the
server for a reply. [83] Rosbridge provides a websocket interface to ROS systems. It will
provide interface to front-end technologies like ReactJs which builds the UI and publishes
a web application. Rosbridge suite is a meta-package containing rosbridge, various front
end packages for Rosbridge like a WebSocket package, and helper packages. [88]

roslibjs provides base dependencies and support libraries for ROS. roslib contains many
of the common data structures and tools that are shared across ROS client library imple-
mentations. [89] It will provides support to interact with basic ROS functionalities like
topics, services, parameter servers and others.

ros3djs is the standard JavaScript 3D visualization manager for ROS. It is build on-
top of roslibjs and utilizes the power of three.js [80]. Many standard ROS features like
interactive markers, URDFs, and maps are included as part of this library. [87]

visualization-rwt package is a suite of nodes for web based robot visualization. It
provides nodes for controlling the robot using MoveIt through web application. [1]




                                                                                  Page 21
4       Hardware Integration
4.1     Installation and Configuration
After testing and simulating the system design in the simulation software, construction
and installation of individual systems begin. This section explains the installation and
configuration of each system with their individual components, while also explaining their
functionality.


4.1.1     Detection marker
Detection marker is a 15 × 13 200 mm pattern that is used to determine the pose of a
system placed in the workcell using the VISOR® vision sensor mounted on the KR. The
pose represents the position and orientation in 3D space. In total, there are ten markers
in the robotic workcell. One each for bending machine unit and unloading station; and
ten markers for the storage station.
    In addition to get the pose, detection marker is used as calibration plate for auto
calibration of camera w.r.t. TCP.


4.1.2     Bending machine unit
Bending machine is set to operate automatically by controlling the foot pedal with PLC.
To automate the bending process, several devices and components are installed on the
bending machine. Bending machine is operated freely upto a certain point i.e. without
any pressure and only starts applying pressure when it is in contact with the sheet metal
part. Figure ?? shows these components.

1.   Marker

Detection marker mounted on the bending machine. This pose is used as reference frame
for all three bending stations. Since the bending machine is fixed, this marker is also used
for auto calibration of the robotic camera.

2.   Bending machine open height measurement sensor

It is important to know exactly the current open height of the bending machine. This
value tells the KR to open the pneumatic parallel gripper as sheet starts bending at a
bending station to avoid any deformation in the sheet. Once the bending is complete, the
KR can move out safely without any collision if a set-point on the open height is reached.


                                                                                   Page 22
                                          CHAPTER 4: HARDWARE INTEGRATION


    For this, a laser sensor is mounted on the bending machine which measures the open
height of the bending machine. The sensor values are sent to the PLC. KR makes decision
to do bending operation based on this laser sensor value.

3.   Bending station

There are three bending stations in the bending machine. Each bending station has a
different set of punch and die. Bending station 1 is used to achieve a bending of 90°.
Bending station 2 bends the sheet metal part at an angle of 135°. And finally, bending
station is used to press down the sheet and make it flat.
    These three stations are enough for the sheet bending operation. KR1410 will take
the sheet metal part to one of these bending station to perform a bending of a particular
angle. A sheet metal part could require the use of one or more of these bending stations.

4.   Terminal Fixture

The bending machine comes with a terminal which is used to operate the bending machine.
However, this terminal is free to rotate and move. It is required to fix the movement of
terminal, so that terminal operating robot could operate reliably. The fixtures made from
aluminium profiles fixes the bending machine terminal.


4.1.3    Robot unit
The robot unit consists of three assemblies: a base, a robot and an end-effector. (Figure
??). The robot is a manipulator from kassow robots with pneumatic parallel grippers
as the end-effector. Pneumatic gripper is controlled by PLC. VISOR® camera is also
mounted on the tool-IO which is used for robotic perception.

1.   Robot base

The base is a simple welded construction made of steel. The choice of steel material
ensures that the base has sufficient dead weight so that it can be transported together
with the robot and gripper using a pallet truck without the risk of tipping over. During
operation, the robot unit is fixed to the floor with four M12 screws.

2.   KR1410 manipulator

The robot used is a 7-axis robot from Kassow Robots with model KR1410. This robot
model fulfills the requirements defined in the section 3.2. Simulations have shown that
this robot is above to reach even the lowest drawers of the shelf of the storage station.
Two full rotations (720°) of five out of seven joints allows complex motions in limited
space. A flexible conduit containing pneumatic hose for the pneumatic parallel gripper

                                                                                 Page 23
                                           CHAPTER 4: HARDWARE INTEGRATION


and communication cabel for the camera goes around the manipulator to reach the end-
effector.

3.   Manual quick-change system

The gripper is attached to a manual quick-change system. The manual quick-change
system makes it possible to exchange different gripper designs in a short time and without
increased effort if required for a sheet metal part type. Sheet metal part is folded into
something like a box. The quick-change system also has an electric and pneumatic power
feed-through, which ensures simple, user-friendly changeover.

4.   Robotic Gripper

The gripper is a Schunk pneumatic parallel gripper. It is powered and controlled by
the Tool-IO board on the KR1410. The robotic gripper grips an object with an applied
pressure of five bar. This is enough to hold the sheet metal part in place during motion
of the arm. The fingers are made from aluminium material and finger tips are 3D printed
using a FDM printer. The tips are worn out after some period of time, but are easily
replacable by 3D printing. In the program tree, TCP is set at the center of the finger tips
of the robotic gripper.

5.   Robotic Camera

A camera system is installed on the robot itself. This is used to determine the relative
position between the robot unit and the unloading station, bending machine and storage
station using the markers and between the robot unit and the sheet metal part (when it
is first made available at the unloading station or is gripped) using features on the sheet
metal part. As the working distance of this camera is large 300mm, using external light
source is required to protect against ambient light. This is because light reflections or
changing extraneous light can distort evaluation results.


4.1.4    Storage station
The storage station is a shelf of 10 drawers and is constructed entirely from aluminum
profiles. At the heart of the storage box are the modular drawers, which consist of a
universal basic construction and individual sheet metal part support plates. The basic
construction consists of an aluminum profile frame, two telescopic rails and a locking
mechanism, which prevents the drawer from moving unintentionally when pulled out or
pushed in. Due to the greater need for profiles and connection technology, the costs for
this construction method are somewhat higher, but the storage box can be manufactured




                                                                                  Page 24
                                             CHAPTER 4: HARDWARE INTEGRATION


precisely as a result, which will have a positive effect on process reliability later when the
sheet metal parts are stored.
    The individual drawers could be pulled out using telescopic rails automatically by the
robot. The individual drawer is a 30 mm thick plate with regularly arranged recesses,
which enables the finished sheet metal parts to be placed in a defined position for the
robot unit. For weight reasons, plastic was the only material considered and the drawers
are printed using AM. Due to the possibility of customizing the sheet metal part carrier
plate, the focus of the design implementation was on designing a carrier plate that can
be used for several sheet metal part variants at the same time. On the one hand, this
saves material resources, and on the other hand, different sheet metal part carrier plates
do not have to be kept in stock or the storage boxes do not always have to be converted
when changing products.
    Each drawer has its own locking mechanism. This is operated with a handle on the
front by turning it clockwise or anticlockwise. The handle also serves as a gripping object
for the robot unit, by means of which the drawer can be pulled out or pushed in. In
addition to this locking mechanism, each storage box has a locking bar across all drawers.
This is intended to serve as an additional safeguard when the boxes are moved between
different factory halls and/or over longer distances using a forklift truck. In addition, each
individual drawer is equipped with a detection marker pattern that is used to determine
the spatial position using the camera on the robot unit. This is required for the reliable
depositing of the sheet metal parts.


4.1.5     Unloading station

4.2      System Networking
PLC is used to control the subsystems in the robotic workcell. PLC controls the bending
process by controlling the bending machine, operates the unloading station to get new
sheet metal parts to the unloading station gripper using the gantry robot, triggers the
inspection camera for testing the bending process and cooperates with the KR1410 to
select the correct bending task. To achieve all of this, communication needs to be setup
between various subsystems. Figure ?? shows the networking diagram between various
devices in the workcell. ROS PC has not been commissioned in the robotic workcell, but
a setup could easily be done by connecting an ethernet cable between robot controller
and laptop.


4.2.1     Communication between KR1410 Robot and PLC
The communication between the PLC and KR1410 is established over Profinet, a leading
industrial ethernet protocol for communication between devices in industrial automation

systems. Profinet (usually styled as PROFINET, as a portmanteau for Process Field Net)
ensures real-time data transmission and supports various network topologies. [44]
    A number of robot data can be monitored and controller through PLC over Profinet.
These include monitoring of system state, joint configuration, TCP kinematics, IO Board,
Tool IO state, and controlling of master speed, IO Board, and Tool IO outputs. The
profinet also allows the transfer of data from Robot to PLC over user defined 64 Bit

4.2.2    VISOR Communication Protocols
Both VISOR camera has been configured beforehand for camera settings like shutter
speed, gain, working distance, resolution, internal illumination and other parameters.
VISOR has been connected to a PC running SensoConfig software from SENSOPART
for configuring the camera. Using this software, separate jobs could also be added for
each task. The task could include detecting a particular sheet pattern, target marker
detection or bend angle measurement. CBun VISOR device added to KR teach pendant
only allows switching of jobs, triggering camera, performing calibration and a few other
tasks. But training to recognise a pattern needs to be done beforehand using a PC.




                                                                                Page 27

1.    VISOR to KR1410

Kassow robot is interfaced to the robotic camera using ethernet. CBun Device installed
on KR teach pendant allows for communication between Kassow robot and the VISOR.
It is build and installed using CBun development as mentioned in subsection 3.4.2. The
following ports are used for communications between the Kassow Robot and the VISOR.

     • Port 2005, Transmission control protocol TCP (Implicit results, i.e. user-configured
       result data)

     • Port 2006, Transmission control protocol TCP (Explicit results, e.g. trigger or job
       switch)

   Figure ?? shows the use of this communication setup to perform auto-calibration with
the Kassow robots and the mounted camera.

2.    VISOR to PLC

PLC is interfaced with the inspection camera using Profinet. UDP (User Datagram
Protocol) is used over ports 161, 34962, 34963, 34964 to establish communication between
the PLC and the VISOR. [67]


4.3       Safety Considerations
Even though the robot chosen is a collaborative robot, the payload is a metal sheet which
poses a safety concern for the human operator. To avoid such scenarios a safety fence is
installed at the boundary of robotic workcell as mentioned in section 3.1.6. Still several
considerations are required for the safe operation of robot in the workcell like the speed
at which the robot should operate. These factors depends on the payload attached to the
robot and the distance between payload and the joint axis 1 or joint axis 2. Following
subsections explains the reasoning behind safety parameters that were considered for the
safe operation of KR1410.


4.3.1      Payload
The pneumatic parellel gripper, manual quick-change system and robotic camera consti-
tutes a weight of 2.0 kg. This is the fixed load on the tool flange center (TFC). The sheet
metal parts counts as the payload. It is a variable load of only 0.1 kg and is thus ignored
for the calculations in 4.3.2.
    The permissible payload is constrained due to the static torque limit of the wrist joints.
The payload is reduced according to the proximity of the payload’s centre of gravity in
relation to joint axis 5, 6 and 7. [49, page 35] Only about 1100 mm out of 1400 mm

                                                                                     Page 28
                                                 CHAPTER 4: HARDWARE INTEGRATION


of workspace is utilized by the KR in the workcell. Figure ?? illustrates the allowable
payload as a function of distance. It’s evident from this it is safe to operate with a load
a 2.0 kg.


4.3.2     Stopping Distance
The stopping time tbrake and distance sbrake should be kept as low as possible. sbrake is set
at 60 mm and tbrake at 0.2 s for safety reason. According to [49, page 35], the time and
distance it takes to stop the robot, for instance with an emergency stop or protective stop,
depends on the load, speed and configuration of the robot. Conservative estimations of
tbrake and sbrake are made by firstly identifying how fast the slowest joints can decelerate.
This depends on the payload, the direction in which the payload is heading relative to
gravity, and the distance between the load or TFC and joint axis 1 or 2, depending on
whatever distance is the longest. The values can be seen in the Table 4.3.

   The stopping time tbrake and stopping distance sbrake can now be conservatively esti-
mated based on the knowledge of the set speed in the robot program and equations 4.2
and 4.3. Joint speed ω is used for Move J and linear speed vmax for Move L and Move S
commands. By default in normal run mode of program, Move J command runs a maxi-
mum joint speed of 90 deg/s and Move L command runs a maximum linear speed of 1000
mm/s. This linear speed can be converted to joint speed using the equation 4.1.

    From these equations, it is evident that tbrake and sbrake are directly proportional to ω.
To avoid triggering joint torque value exceeded error and for safe operation of robot, the
joint speed ω is reduced for specifically difficult trajectory execution or when the distance

between joint axis 1 or joint axis 2 and TFC is large. For example, to keep the same tbrake
for a distance of 900 mm between Joint axis 1 and payload but two robot configuration of
0-40 deg and 120-160 deg, joint speed ω must be halved for 0-40 deg robot configuration.


4.3.3    Safety zones
Safety Zones represent virtual boundaries in the robot workspace. The robot will reduce
its speed or stop completely if any part of the robot enters the safety zone. This can be
used for protection of sensitive equipment or areas with human presence. [52, page 96]
    A safety zone for unloading station, storage station, bending machine and terminal
operating robot is created. Since the robot can actually touch the floor, an additional
safety zone is added for the floor. The robot will stop immediately if it ever exceeds the
safety zone boundary. It it exceeds, then the operator has to manually move the robotic
arm back inside the safety zone.


4.3.4    Safety functions
Safety functions evaluate external and internal signals of the whole system which can
act immediately to halt the robot or cut him loose from power if necessary. The safety
function of KR complies with EN ISO 13849-1:2015. [21] [52, page 13]
    In the main program of teach pendant, there are two sequences programmed to run
in parallel to halt or stop the program if a signal is detected from the PLC. The former
sequence pauses the robot motion and waits for a new signal from PLC to continue the
robot motion from the same configuration while the latter sequence triggers the E-Stop
on the robot and stops the robot immediately.

1.   Protective STOP

The Protective STOP can be used interactively by the operator to pause and continue
the running program. After the protective STOP is released, the program can continue
running its normal operation.

2.   Emergency STOP

The emergency STOP buttons of robot are present at both teach pendant and robot
controller. These buttons are used to engage inbuilt safety measures and halt the robot in
order to prevent a potentially hazardous situation The emergency STOP always provoke
immediate halt of the robot, followed by the power cut to all executive parts of the robot.
   Besides these E-stop buttons, there are three more E-Stop in the workcell. Two are
placed on the bending machine and one on the front panel of unloading station as shown



                                                                                  Page 30

machine and unloading station mechatronic system.

5        Software Development
5.1      Control Software
By analyzing the current manual process on the bending machine, a flowchart for the
mobile robot unit is developed for the automated bending process. This diagram, which
is still partly abstract, enables the individual activities of the unit to be identified and their
interactions to be described right at the start of the research project. The requirements
for the overall system are also defined, which are explained in more detail in subchapter
??. The description of the process and the definition of the overall requirements represent
an interacting process that inevitably had to be iterated through. This means that the
results of both work packages were revised several times. The final result of these iterations
regarding the activities to be performed by the mobile robot unit can be seen in Figure 1
and Figure 2. Five essential components of the unit emerge from the process. These are
as follows: Feeding, alignment, bending, checking and depositing.
     In the first step, the feed, the sheet metal is to be separated from a stack of sheets. The
advantage of arranging the raw sheets in stacks is that as many parts as possible can be
stored in as little space as possible. Conversely, this means that more space is available for
the bent sheet metal parts, which is of great importance due to the limited space available
on site at the company. The sheet thickness is also checked in advance during feeding
and parts outside the tolerance are sorted out. Furthermore, this information should be
taken into account in the further course of the process when adjusting the parameters of
the bending machine.
     For space reasons, a device should be integrated into the feeder that allows the robot
to grip the sheet metal at a new position if necessary, as otherwise collisions between the
robot and the bending machine may occur during the subsequent bending process if the
robot is not realigned. During the bending process, there should be two different design
variants depending on the sheet variant. With small sheets, the robot lets go of the sheet,
which has an advantageous effect on the robot programming. In order to prevent twisting
in the case of larger parts, it is essential to hold them throughout the entire bending
process. The challenge here lies in programming a robot movement whose path and path
speed matches the movement of the sheet metal, which in turn depends on the lowering
speed of the bending punch.
     A camera system is used to record both the angle and length of the sheet metal after
each individual bending process. The angle is used to readjust the bending machines.
The length measurements serve as a further instrument for monitoring the process. If a
large number of rejects occur in a very short time, the entire process is to be stopped.


                                                                                         Page 32

6       System Integration and Testing
6.1      Calibration
Calibration is a crucial procedure in the development of an automated robotic workcell,
ensuring that all components operate accurately and in harmony.


6.1.1     Robot Calibration
Robot calibration ensures that the Kassow robot can accurately position its end effector
for loading, bending, and unloading metal sheets. This involves:

    • Kinematic Calibration: Adjusting the robot’s kinematic model to correct any
      discrepancies between the theoretical model and the actual hardware. This includes
      measuring and compensating for joint offsets, link lengths, and joint angles.

    • Tool Center Point (TCP) Calibration: Determining the exact position of the
      end effector or tool relative to the robot’s last joint. This is crucial for precise
      manipulation of metal sheets.

    • Workspace Calibration: Defining the robot’s operational workspace and ensuring
      that all tasks are performed within this defined area, avoiding collisions and ensuring
      smooth operation.

   The KR1410 is already calibrated from the factory and does not need to be setup.
Though in simulation, robot kinematic model is generated from the URDF and needs to
be updated to match the real hardware.


6.1.2     Camera Calibration
The ”Hand-Eye calibration (Robotics)” calibration method is used to determine the refer-
ence between ”Hand” (TCP) and ”Eye” Camera coordinate system (position and orienta-
tion) when the VISOR® is attached to the gripper. This allows different image acquisition
positions and still to output the object positions in robot coordinates directly from the
camera. [68, page 102]
    Camera calibration is essential for the accurate detection of metal sheets and mea-
surement of bending angles. The process involves:

    • Intrinsic Calibration: Determining the camera’s internal parameters, such as
      focal length, optical center, and lens distortion. This is typically achieved using a
      calibration target (e.g., a checkerboard pattern) and specialized software tools.

                                                                                    Page 36
                              CHAPTER 6: SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND TESTING


   • Extrinsic Calibration: Establishing the camera’s position and orientation relative
     to the robot or the workcell. This involves aligning the camera’s coordinate system
     with the robot’s coordinate system to ensure accurate detection and measurement.


6.1.3    Sensor Calibration
Laser sensor is added to the bending machine to measure the distance between the tool
and die with the reproducibility in the range of 10µm. This sensor help in coordinating the
bending timings between the bending machine and the robot. This sensor also requires a
baseline or zero point to eliminate any offsets or biases in their readings.


6.1.4    Calibration Procedures
The calibration process is automated within the robot program such that operator could
request to re-calibrate the camera w.r.t robot TCP from the touch panel. This allows to
update the image quality as it degrades over time. The robot finishes the current bending
operation and then in next cycle, start with the auto-calibration.
   The calibration process involves several systematic steps:

  1. Setup Calibration Targets: Place calibration targets within the robot’s workspace
     and at specific positions that the cameras will observe.

  2. Data Collection: Use the robot and cameras to collect data from the calibration
     targets. This includes moving the robot through its range of motion and capturing
     images from different angles.

  3. Parameter Estimation: Use calibration software to estimate the parameters of
     the robot’s kinematic model, the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the cameras,
     and the characteristics of any other sensors.

  4. Validation: Verify the calibration by performing tasks that require high precision
     and checking the accuracy of the results. Adjust calibration parameters as needed
     based on validation results.

  5. Documentation: Record the calibration parameters and procedures for future
     reference and troubleshooting.

6.3.1    Calibration Results
Calibration is fundamental to ensuring the accuracy and reliability of an automated
robotic workcell. Proper calibration:

   • Enhances Precision: Ensures that the robot and sensors operate with high accu-
     racy, essential for tasks like metal sheet bending where precise angles and positions
     are critical.

   • Improves Consistency: Reduces variability in operations, leading to consistent
     product quality and reducing the likelihood of errors.

   • Facilitates Integration: Ensures that all components of the workcell operate
     cohesively, enabling smooth integration and coordination.

   • Supports Troubleshooting: Provides a baseline for identifying and resolving
     issues that may arise during operation.

   By establishing rigorous calibration procedures, the automated robotic workcell can
achieve optimal performance, ensuring that the bending process is executed with high
precision and reliability.

9.2.1     Control Software Update
For a single sheet metal part, teach pendant from the kassow robot is enough for the
control program. However, to allow flexibility in production with different sheet metal
part, a separate hardware is required to run ROS controller manager. At the moment,
ROS is only used for visualizing the robot motion in the web app. In order to be able
to quickly create a new robot program for new sheet metal part variants, simulation
software is to be developed with the help of ROS. With the help of this software, path
trajectories between the individual subsystems (sheet pickup station, bending machine,
shelf storage) can be generated in advance without having to remove the real robot unit
from any ongoing production, which can then be easily integrated into the new robot
program on the real robot.

    • Adding camera data to the digital twin.

    • Storage for web applications.

    • Creating App for phones.
