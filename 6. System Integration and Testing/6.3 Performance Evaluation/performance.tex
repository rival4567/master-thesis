\subsection{Importance of Calibration}
Calibration is fundamental to ensuring the accuracy and reliability of an automated robotic workcell. Proper calibration:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enhances Precision}: Ensures that the robot and sensors operate with high accuracy, essential for tasks like metal sheet bending where precise angles and positions are critical.
    \item \textbf{Improves Consistency}: Reduces variability in operations, leading to consistent product quality and reducing the likelihood of errors.
    \item \textbf{Facilitates Integration}: Ensures that all components of the workcell operate cohesively, enabling smooth integration and coordination.
    \item \textbf{Supports Troubleshooting}: Provides a baseline for identifying and resolving issues that may arise during operation.
\end{itemize}

By establishing rigorous calibration procedures, the automated robotic workcell can achieve optimal performance, ensuring that the bending process is executed with high precision and reliability.
