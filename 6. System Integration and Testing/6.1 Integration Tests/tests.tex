A test specimen sheet metal part is selected for the testing of the bending process. This test part has six bending steps. It makes use of all three bending stations \textit{i.e.} bendings of 90\textdegree, 135\textdegree and flattening of sheet is performed. The test part is small in size, hence the KR1410 does not need to hold it during bending. The following sections show the manipulation of this test part through various substations for pickup, bending, inspection and placement. This test part will exhibit that all the substations of the robotic are integrated correctly for the automated bending process.
