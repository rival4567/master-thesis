This thesis successfully demonstrates the development of an automated robotic workcell for bending sheet metal parts using the KR1410 robot. The KR1410 robot handles all bending tasks, which are unloading, alignment, bending, checking and loading of sheet in an industrial environment. The robotic workcell is thoroughly evaluated, and its performance is measured across key parameters.

The results shows that the automation of the bending process offers significant advantages in terms of quality consistency as compared to manual bending. Despite a slightly longer cycle time when compared to established systems like AMADA's bending cell, the KR1410 robotic workcell has robust capabilities, particularly in terms of adaptability and error handling using a robotic camera. The addition of an inspection camera also enabled quality assurances during production.

This thesis contibutes to the field of industrial automation, particularly for smaller production systems looking for low-volume, customizable and flexible automation solutions.
