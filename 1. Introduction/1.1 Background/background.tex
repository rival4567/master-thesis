The manufacturing sector is increasingly driven by the need for efficiency, precision, and cost reduction. Traditional metal fabrication processes, such as the bending of metal sheets, often rely heavily on manual labor. This reliance not only limits production scalability but also introduces variability in product quality and exposes workers to physical strain and repetitive motion injuries. As the industry advances, there is a significant push towards automation to address these challenges and enhance overall productivity.

Robotic automation in manufacturing has emerged as a viable solution to improve process efficiency, ensure consistent product quality, and reduce human labor requirements. The advent of sophisticated robotic systems, such as the Kassow robot, combined with advancements in computer vision and control systems, provides new opportunities to automate complex tasks like metal sheet bending.
