Manual bending of metal sheets is labor-intensive and can 
lead to human errors, resulting in inconsistent quality
and inefficiency. The automation of this process poses
several challenges, including the precise detection and
processing of metal sheets, the accurate execution of
the bend operation and the effective coordination of
the robotic system with the loading and unloading system.

This robotic workcell will have automatic loading and unloading
of metal sheets in the AMADA bending machine and will use
computer vision to detect
and measure the bend angle of metal sheets.
In addition, a user-friendly interface will be developed for
monitoring and controlling the robotic workcell.
