Manual metal sheet bending is labor-intensive and prone to human errors, leading to inconsistent quality and inefficiency. Automating this process presents several challenges, including the need for precise detection and handling of metal sheets, accurate execution of bending operations, and effective coordination of the robotic system. Additionally, there is a requirement for a user-friendly interface to monitor and control the robotic workcell.

The primary objective of this research is to develop an automated robotic workcell using a Kassow robot for the bending process. This workcell will include capabilities for automatic loading and unloading of metal sheets and will leverage computer vision for metal sheet detection and bending angle measurement. Furthermore, a web interface will be developed to visualize the robotic motion and provide real-time system status updates.
