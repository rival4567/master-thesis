Manual bending of metal sheets is labor-intensive and can 
lead to human errors, resulting in inconsistent quality
and inefficiency. 
The automation of this process with a collaborative robot poses
several challenges, which includes the precise detection and processing of sheet metal parts, the accurate execution of
the bend operation and the coordination of
the robotic system with other systems in the workcell.

This robotic workcell will have automatic loading and unloading
of metal sheets in the \hyperref[acro:AMADA]{AMADA} bending machine and will use
computer vision to detect
and measure the bend angle of metal sheets.
In addition, a user-friendly interface will be developed for
monitoring the robotic workcell.
