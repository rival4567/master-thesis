The formulation and realization of an automatic robotic workcell for bending metal sheets has a major influence on the manufacturing industry. Automating this process allows manufacturers to improve upon product quality accuracy and consistency, reduce dependence on manual labor, and maximize overall production efficiency. The research contributes to the broadest field of industrial automation and robotics and shows how Industry 4.0 can transform traditional manufacturing processes.

This study focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a robotic workcell for the bending process using a KR. The scope includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integration of computer vision systems for the detection of metal sheets and the measurement of bending angles.
    \item Develop control software for robotic systems. 
    \item Creating a web interface for monitoring and control.
    \item Experimental evaluation of system performance in the industrial environments. 
\end{itemize}

The study does not address other aspects of metal manufacturing or the integration of additional manufacturing processes.
