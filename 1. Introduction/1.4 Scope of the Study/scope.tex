The development of robotic workcell that can be rapidly configured has a major influence on the manufacturing industry. It allows for more flexibility and mass customization in production of parts. \cite{CHEN2001199} Automating the bending process allows manufacturers to increase productivity, safety, flexibility, and overall process efficiency while having the option for customization. \cite[page 9]{russmann2015industry} 

This thesis contributes to the broadest field of industrial automation and robotics and shows how Industry 4.0 can transform traditional manufacturing processes.
The scope consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Programming control software for the robotic system. 
    \item Integration of computer vision systems for the detection and inspection of metal sheets.
    \item Building a web interface for monitoring and visualization.
    \item Experimental evaluation of system performance in the industrial environment. 
\end{itemize}

The thesis does not discuss other aspects of metal manufacturing or the integration of other manufacturing processes.
The programming of the second robot i.e. Franka Emika panda robot and \hyperref[acro:PLC]{PLC} in the robotic workcell is out of scope of this thesis.
