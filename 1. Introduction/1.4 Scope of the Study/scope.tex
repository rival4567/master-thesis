The development of an automated robotic workcell for metal sheet bending holds significant implications for the manufacturing industry. By automating this process, manufacturers can achieve higher precision and consistency in product quality, reduce the reliance on manual labor, and enhance overall production efficiency. This study contributes to the broader field of industrial automation and robotics, showcasing how advanced technologies can transform traditional manufacturing processes.

This study focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a robotic workcell for the bending process using a Kassow robot. The scope includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integration of computer vision systems for metal sheet detection and angle measurement.
    \item Development of control software for the robotic system.
    \item Creation of a web interface for monitoring and control.
    \item Experimental evaluation of the system's performance in a simulated industrial environment.
\end{itemize}

The study does not cover other aspects of metal fabrication or the integration of additional manufacturing processes.
