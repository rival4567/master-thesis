The thesis is divided into nine chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the 
background, problem statement, objectives, significance, and scope 
of the study. Chapter 2 reviews state-of-the-art technologies in the
industry for automation. Chapter 3 and 4 describes the design and development
of the robotic workcell, containing both hardware and software components.
Chapter 5 discusses the 
development of the control software and web interface. Chapter 6 
presents the calibration process and testing methodology for the 
robotic workcell. Chapter 7 provides the results of the experimental 
evaluation of the system. Chapter 8 analyzes the findings, discusses 
implications, and addresses potential limitations. Finally, Chapter 9
summarizes the research contributions and suggests directions for
future research.
