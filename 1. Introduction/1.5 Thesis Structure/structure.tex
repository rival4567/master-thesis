The thesis is organized into nine chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the background, problem statement, objectives, significance, and scope of the study. Chapter 2 reviews existing research and technologies related to robotic automation, computer vision in manufacturing, and automated bending processes. Chapter 3 describes the design of the robotic workcell, including both hardware and software components. Chapter 4 details the integration of the Kassow robot, cameras, and other hardware components. Chapter 5 discusses the development of the control software and web interface. Chapter 6 presents the integration process and testing methodology for the robotic workcell. Chapter 7 provides the results of the experimental evaluation of the system. Chapter 8 analyzes the findings, discusses implications, and addresses potential limitations. Finally, Chapter 9 summarizes the research contributions and suggests directions for future research.
