The thesis is divided into nine chapters. Chapter \ref{chap:introduction} clearly defines the 
problem statement. Chapter \ref{chap:review} reviews state-of-the-art technologies in the
industry for automation. Chapter \ref{chap:design} and \ref{chap:integration} describes the design and development
of the robotic workcell, containing both hardware and software components.
Chapter \ref{chap:development} discusses the 
programming of the control software and web interface. Chapter \ref{chap:testing} 
presents the calibration process and evaluation of the entire
robotic workcell. Chapter \ref{chap:results} provides the results and Chapter \ref{chap:discussion} analyzes the results, discusses 
their implications, and addresses potential limitations. In the end, Chapter \ref{chap:conclusion}
summarizes the whole thesis and makes suggestions for
future research.
