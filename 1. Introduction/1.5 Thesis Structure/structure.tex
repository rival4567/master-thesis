The thesis is divided into nine chapters. Chapter 1 clearly defines the 
problem statement. Chapter 2 reviews state-of-the-art technologies in the
industry for automation. Chapter 3 and 4 describes the design and development
of the robotic workcell, containing both hardware and software components.
Chapter 5 discusses the 
programming of the control software and web interface. Chapter 6 
presents the calibration process and evaluation of the entire
robotic workcell. Chapter 7 provides the results and Chapter 8 analyzes the results, discusses 
their implications, and addresses potential limitations. In the end, Chapter 9
summarizes the whole thesis and makes suggestions for
future research.
