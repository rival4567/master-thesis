\section*{Chapter 1: Introduction}

Robotic systems are widely used in various industries to perform repetitive
and/or precise activities, increasing productivity and quality while reducing
hazardous or uncomfortable jobs for workers.
Bending is an important industrial process used in industries such as
automotive, aerospace, and construction to bend metal sheets or components
into the necessary shapes. Traditionally, bending activities were done manually
or with dedicated bending equipment. However, bending by hand is labor-
intensive and prone to irregularities, whereas standard bending devices have
limited flexibility and adaptability.
The incorporation of robotics into bending operations has numerous benefits.
Robots can conduct bending operations with high reproducibility and precision,
resulting in consistent quality across a wide range of items. Furthermore, robotic
bending systems may be rapidly modified to fit changing item shapes and
production requirements, increasing manufacturing flexibility and agility.
