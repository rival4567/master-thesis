The objectives of this research are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Developing a cost-effective solution for the automated bending process, that could replace a human operator on the bending machine while also keeping the initial costs down. The solution should be able to handle a variety of metal sheets as a human operator would be able to, allowing for flexibility in production.
    \item Production of parts should continue non-stop without any assistance from the human operator. It means the production should't stop during off hours.
    \item The solution should have a high value of accuracy in the bending process and should be able to self-adjust bending parameters to improve the bending process automatically.
    \item There should be a possibility for remote monitoring and control of the bending process, so that human operator could visualize and program the bending process of a new sheet metal part variant from outside the production space, avoiding downtime that happens during the programming of new part.
\end{enumerate}
