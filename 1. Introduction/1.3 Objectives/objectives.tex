The objectives of this research are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design and development of a robotic workcell capable of bending metal sheets autonomously. The workcell includes AMADA HFP80-25 NT as the bending machine to be automated, KR1410 as the robot, SensoPart vision sensors as cameras, an unloading station to get sheets from the operator and a shelf for placing the sheets.
    \item Integration of computer vision technology to detect metal sheets accurately for pick-up and measure bending angle. One VISOR\textsuperscript{\textregistered} vision sensor mounted on the KR1410 will be used for sheet detection and second VISOR\textsuperscript{\textregistered} placed in robot workspace for measuring bending angle. Communication between the camera and robot needs to be setup using Telegram.
    \item Develop a web interface for the visualization and monitoring of robotic workcell in real time. The web interface communicates with the robot through ROS Bridge library to the web interface. The interface to be developed using web development technologies like ReactJS, NodeJS, Javascript, HTML5, and vanilla CSS.
    \item Evaluate the efficiency, accuracy and reduction of manual labor of the robotic workcell.
