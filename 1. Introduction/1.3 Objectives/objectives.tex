The specific objectives of this research are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To design and implement a robotic workcell capable of autonomously performing metal sheet bending.
    \item To integrate computer vision techniques for accurate detection of metal sheets and measurement of bending angles.
    \item To develop a web interface for real-time visualization and monitoring of the robotic workcell.
    \item To evaluate the performance of the automated system in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and reduction in manual labor.
\end{enumerate}
