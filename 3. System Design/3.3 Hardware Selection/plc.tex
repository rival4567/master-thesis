PLC
A programmable logic controller (PLC) is a special form of microprocessor-based controller that uses programmable memory to store 
instructions and to implement functions such as logic, sequencing, timing, counting, and arithmetic in order to control machines and processes. \cite[page 5]{bolton2015programmable}
It is an industrial computer that has been ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, 
such as system monitoring, motor control, workcells, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming, and process fault diagnosis. \cite{ALPHONSUS20161185}

\hyperref[acro:PLC]{PLC} from the manufacturer Siemens are called SIMATIC Controller. \cite{siemens} A SIMATIC \hyperref[acro:HMI]{HMI} is also added to the top of front panel of the unloading station to provide
relevant information to the operator as shown in figure \ref{fig:unloading-station-front} PLC is used to manage everything in robotic workcell,
from giving instructions to the \hyperref[acro:KR]{KR} to controlling the bending machine and unloading station.
