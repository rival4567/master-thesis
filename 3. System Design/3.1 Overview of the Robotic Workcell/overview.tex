Robotic workcell has to be designed keeping in mind the workspace of handling robot. Handling robot has to able to reach every station in the workspace without any collision. 
The workcell is first developed in simulation with the use of ROS and gazebo software. This reduced the development time as it allowed for quick changes to the workcell.

The preliminary designs for the robotic workcell were elaborated
in the form of \hyperref[acro:CAD]{CAD} models and successively converted into final \hyperref[acro:CAD]{CAD} designs. 
These \hyperref[acro:CAD]{CAD} models were later converted to suitable file format like \textit{.stl} and \textit{.dae} for the simulation software \hyperref[acro:ROS]{ROS}.
These meshes are then utilized to build up the whole workcell in \hyperref[acro:ROS]{ROS} and gazebo. Robot is defined in \hyperref[acro:URDF]{URDF} file format that includes
the physical description of the robot. \cite{urdf} This simulated environment in gazebo is used to update and fix the final layout of the robotic workcell.
Trajectories are planned to various subsystems in workcell using \hyperref[acro:ROS]{ROS} to determine to final position of robot in workcell.
Figure \ref{fig:robotic-workcell} shows the final layout of the workcell in gazebo software.
It consists of various subsystems which include bending machine, storage station, unloading station, handling robot, bending machine terminal operating robot and safety fence.

The subsystems are described in more detail in the following
subsections. 


Sheets are loaded by workcell operator in the unloading station. Sheet metal parts are picked up by the handling robot and taken to bending machine to perform bending.
After all the bending operations are complete, sheet metal parts are stored in storage station.
The relation between each subsystem and the flow of energy, data, and material is shown in Figure \ref{fig:flow-workcell}.
