Safety fence marks the boundary of the robotic workcell. Even though the robot finalized is a collaborative robot,
bending machine poses a safety concern as it is operated automatically by the \hyperref[acro:PLC]{PLC}. The sheet metal parts are sharp
around the corners and when handled by the robot is deemed as not safe.

Two doors are installed for an entry in the robotic workcell. One is close to the storage system and is used
to move shelf in-and-out of the workcell by a forklift. The doors are installed with a safety mechanism such that if the door is open, the whole robot unit and bending machine cannot operate. This safety mechanism 
is again controlled by the \hyperref[acro:PLC]{PLC}. Safety fence is only installed at the end of the project by the company.
A simulation of the fence with \hyperref[acro:ROS]{ROS} and gazebo is not necessary in this case and is not included as assets in gazebo.
