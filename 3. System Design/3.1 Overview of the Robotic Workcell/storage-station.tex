The storage station is a shelf with 10 drawers. The drawers of the shelf can be automatically opened and closed by the
handling robot. It is a mechanical system which is used to store final bended sheet metal parts.

When the storage station is full, human operators are to replace a filled shelf with a new empty shelf with a forklift. Thus, this is the only station
which is not fixed in the robotic workcell. The robotic camera mounted on the handling robot needs to determine the correct position of the storage station
after each restart.
